            <p>Dear Friends, Donors, and Partners,</p>
            <p>I think it is safe to say that no one foresaw the extraordinary events of 2020. Each challenge became a
              turning point, an opportunity to think critically and act decisively to find new ways to address
              escalating community needs. The decisions were not always easy; the clear path was not always obvious.
              Fortunately, we were not alone on our journey.</p>
            <p>Here at the Area Foundation, we say Stronger Together all the time. There is a good reason for it.</p>
            <p>In 2020, there was simply no way we could have mobilized the financial resources and human capital to
              respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and social justice without the collaboration of a multitude of
              philanthropic partners, both within and beyond the Area Foundation. The generous spirit of the San Antonio
              community was on display during these tumultuous times, and we are humbled and grateful to serve as
              trusted advisor, supporter, and collaborative partner in philanthropy.</p>
            <h3>COLLABORATIVE GRANTMAKING</h3>
            <p>We were blessed to have a cadre of great leaders interested in helping the community. A special thanks to
              Harvey Najim and the Harvey E. Najim Charitable Foundation, David Rogers and the H. E. Butt Foundation,
              the Nancy Smith Hurd Foundation, and Chris Martin and the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County for
              their willingness to lead, work, fund, and believe in this transformational relief fund.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 Response Fund was launched on March 20, 2020. Hosted by the Area Foundation and jointly
              managed with United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County, the Fund raised $6.4 million through the
              tremendous generosity of hundreds of individual donors and dozens of foundations, businesses, and civic
              institutions who rallied in support of our community during this crisis.</p>
            <p>These funds were distributed to more than 200 regional nonprofits in a rapid-cycle process advanced by
              our Community Engagement and Impact (CEI) team. The average award size was $28,137, and grants were
              prioritized for organizations serving 17 of San Antonios lowest-income zip codes.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 Response Fund focused its grantmaking in the areas of social services, business and
              employment, food security, and shelter. We intentionally aligned with Mayor Ron Nirenbergs key focus areas
              to amplify and coordinate philanthropic and public investments to address the critical needs of San
              Antonians. The Area Foundation also jointly invested with the City of San Antonio and United Way in
              providing temporary childcare access subsidies.</p>
            <p>Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) hosted at the Area Foundation recommended an additional $7 million in direct
              grants to 248 nonprofits, and 95% of all DAF giving in response to COVID-19 stayed in Bexar County.</p>
            <p>Just-In-Time Capacity Building AND Online Resources</p>
            <p>Fortunately for the hundreds of nonprofit professionals the Area Foundation serves through our trainings
              and classes, we upgraded our IT infrastructure before the pandemic struck. Working remotely since March
              2020, our Learning and Development Department staff readily pivoted to online learning opportunities. In
              2020, we offered 77 courses and more than 2,000 participants signed up.</p>
            <p>We delivered timely programs and free community sessions on topics such as: Leadership in Times of
              Transition, Communicating Effectively in Remote Environments, Lead by Example: Sustaining Ourselves,
              Engaging Employees in Remote Environments, and Brave New World: Returning to Work. Also, through a
              partnership with Candid, the Area Foundation offered free, online access for all area nonprofits to the
              Foundation Directory Online the most exhaustive and up-to-date database on grant makers</p>
            <p>Data-Driven Events and Community Engagement</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic fostered many opportunities for us to engage more deeply with donors and supporters
              within and beyond the Area Foundation. Throughout the year, we delivered well-attended philanthropic
              briefings to internal donors and volunteers on COVID-19 and on topics such as corporate social
              responsibility. We engaged a host of civic and business leaders through strategic conversations and with
              organizations as varied as Rotary, Humana, and Vistage.</p>
            <p>The Area Foundation contributed to the Mayors Taskforce on Workforce Development serving as a key
              partner. This taskforce was pivotal to the development of and advocacy for Proposition B, which was
              approved by San Antonio voters in the November election. The initiative, SA Ready to Work, funded by a
              one-eighth-cent sales tax, will grow job training programs, scholarships, and emergency financial
              assistance for up to 40,000 residents caught in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
            <h3>Catalytic Investments</h3>
            <p>The Area Foundation provided a start-up grant to the Family Independence Initiative (now UpTogether)
              which fostered partnerships with several local funders to place earned income directly into the hands of
              working families. San Antonio is now one of only a dozen sites across the nation to deploy this innovative
              and proven program which provides access to capital and fuels family-driven solutions. Alongside other
              local partners, the Area Foundation invested in the launch of Get Shift Done for San Antonio and
              neighboring communities. The program coordinates, schedules, and pays adversely affected hourly workers in
              the hospitality industry to work paid shifts for organizations such as the San Antonio Food Bank. It helps
              food service workers who lost their paychecks and provides immediate support to nonprofits stretched in
              providing food service to people in need.</p>
            <p>The Area Foundation partnered with United Way, H. E. Butt Foundation, and LISC San Antonio on a weekly
              survey to more than 100 nonprofits to assess real-time community needs and engage donors on the most
              impactful investments. Our approach on the highest-level poverty zip codes in Bexar County illuminated
              sound and equitable approaches for our philanthropic partners and influenced their grantmaking.</p>
            <p>These are just a few of the highlights featured in our 2020 impact report. You will learn more about our
              commitment and our work to mobilize philanthropy, lead in the community, and operate with excellence.
              Thanks to your partnership, we can continue to serve our communitys needs today, while building a better
              tomorrow for all who call our region home.</p>
            <p>With gratitude,</p>

        <p>
            Quarantine is a cheetah<br>
            because the cases of people who are<br>
            getting the virus<br>
            Are coming in fast. People can’t see<br>
            Their family because of the virus.<br>
            Quarantine makes me feel like<br>
            I can’t do anything anymore.<br>
            I want to outrun this cheetah,<br>
            Be grateful for seafood every Friday<br>
            And for people who recover from Covid.<br>

The other half came in the form of $250 gift cards for residents living at one of the agency’s apartment campuses.</p>

          <p>One of the many devastating effects of the pandemic has been an increase in domestic violence. The <span>Bexar County Family Justice Center</span>, a critical service provider to victims of domestic violence, had to find a way to remain open. This was no easy feat, given that it is typically an in-person, walk-in program.
Before the pandemic, the Area Foundation had already begun the transition to trust-based philanthropy allowing organizations to focus on their mission and adjust or apply the grant dollars where they were needed most. This pivot to operational funding enabled the Bexar County Family Justice Center to apply the needed funds to provide crisis intervention and support services to a larger-than-normal client base. </p>

        The people that SAMMinistries serves struggle during normal circumstances to maintain stability. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified vulnerabilities around such issues as food insecurity, rental assistance, access to hygiene, cleaning supplies, and transportation. Those living in transitional housing lost many outlets to socialize and simply let kids expend their energy. Generous funding helped alleviate these burdens, helping to keep households safe and healthy. It helped pay rent, late fees, and mortgages, making SAMMinistries a one-stop shop to address the housing needs of clients in financial crisis. One hundred percent of homeless prevention and rapid re-housing clients remained housed; 60 percent of transitional clients exited to permanent housing; and 98 percent of permanent supportive housing clients remained housed during the worst of the crisis.

          <h3>4. Successful Aging</h3>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>The pandemic has severely affected all of us, but the impact has been even greater for older San Antonians. It’s not just health outcomes. Some older adults face challenges with social isolation, loneliness, transportation, food security, and mental health. We are all aging and the San Antonio 
      Area Foundation is committed to a community where older adults are respected, thrive, and enjoy connected lives. We are dedicated to Reframing Aging, a social change endeavor designed to change the publics’ perception of aging by empowering us to all live our best lives as we age.

          <p>In 2020, the <span>Successful Aging and Living in San Antonio (SALSA)</span> collective impact initiative built significant momentum. SALSA inspires its 38 multi-sector partners to develop a common agenda and implement agreed upon strategies and activities. Significant accomplishments for SALSA this year include:</p>
          <br>
          <p>• In partnership with <span>WellMed Charitable Foundation</span>, the creation, development, and distribution of the Family Caregiver Toolkit, in Spanish and English, to offer resources to spouses, family, and significant others who provide care for their loved ones.</p>
          <br>
          <p>• Training and launch of our community’s Reframing Aging Initiative.  With training received from <span>The Gerontological Society of America (GSA)</span>, who lead the national reframing aging initiative, SALSA trained and graduated 15 Reframing Aging Facilitators dedicated to using evidence-based, cutting edge communications tools and messages developed by <span>FrameWorks Institute</span>, and tailored for our community.  By changing the way that people talk and think about aging, we are setting the foundation for policies and practices that leverage the strengths and talents of older people, and systems that support well-being for all of us as we age.</p>

        With the second half of its 2019/20 theater season suspended, The Public Theater of San Antonio implemented remote theater arts programming to ensure the community had access to live professional theater experiences to increase the social and emotional well-being of individuals of all ages. By hosting virtual play readings, musical cabarets, instructional classes, and free youth programming, The Public was able to provide income opportunities for displaced performers and technical crew members, supplement youth educational theater arts programming in distance learning settings,

            <h3>Words from former chairman of the board</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              I had many friends check in on me in the summer of 2020. Given everything going on at that time with racial unrest across the country, they just wanted to make sure I was doing OK. I appreciated their care and concern and let them know as much. But I was also honest with them – no, I told them. I have not been OK.
    Following the deaths of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor, and a growing list of African Americans taken away from us far too young and far too soon, I cannot deny feeling personally impacted. It has taken a heavy emotional toll on me.
    As Chairman of the Board of Directors of the San Antonio Area Foundation, I was responsible  —  along with my fellow board members  —  for overseeing the organization’s various programs and activities. Taking on societal ills such as racial injustice and inequity is not new for us  —  but making it an important part of our agenda moving forward is something we have a responsibility to do.
     That is why we sent out an official organizational statement signed by me and Area Foundation CEO Marjie French delineating our stance against discrimination and injustice.
    So, no, I am not OK. I cannot be OK when I reflect on our national climate as our country continues to grapple with its centuries-old racial reckoning. Institutional and systemic racism is still here with us, making its presence felt in all areas of society. 
    Yet this is not about me. It is about my beautiful grandchildren and countless other young African Americans like them. Will they grow up also fearing they will experience the scourge of racism we see rear its ugly head?
    Can you imagine being afraid to call the police in a time of need? Can you imagine having to have the talk with your 10-year-old son just to make sure he knows how to properly respond to a police officer so that he can come home alive? People need to know this is still all too real in our country. 
    I cannot be silent at this time. I need to speak up. We simply cannot move forward without acknowledging the pain and suffering inflicted on the Black community  — indeed, many communities of color  —  without doing the challenging work to change the systems that have ushered such palpable inequities.
    As Chairman of the Area Foundation Board in 2020, I personally witnessed generous and courageous leaders who have given of themselves over our organization’s 55-year history to effect change and to create a community where we can all thrive. There is no better time than now to ask ourselves what we can do to be part of the solution and how we can take ownership of our role as a community leader to address institutional racism and advance equity.
    Change and improvement will not come overnight nor will it be an easy endeavor. But we have the brightest minds in the world, and I am confident we can indeed bring about meaningful change. The only way we can fail is to think we cannot succeed. Yet, we must succeed. Failure is simply not an option, at least not for me  —  my grandchildren’s lives are at stake.

              The urgency of addressing inequities, spurred by the murder of George Floyd, has driven the Area Foundation to provide additional new investments, partnerships, research, and advocacy supporting the African American and other marginalized communities to ensure that we recognize various marginalized communities are disproportionately impacted. Our path to achieving more equitable outcomes began by more intentionally focusing our annual responsive grantmaking on the city’s most distressed zip codes and most disproportionately impacted families.

        <br>
        <p>The San Antonio Equity Fellowship Program is a pilot transformational leadership program focused on bringing together African American and Latinx participants who are committed to constructively altering societal conditions toward fuller justice and equity for all. The San Antonio Area Foundation is pleased to offer this unique opportunity for personal and professional development as part of the Foundation’s commitment to equity work, capacity building of our nonprofit sector, and commitment to strengthen the leaders of nonprofit organizations in San Antonio.
  The San Antonio Equity Fellowship Program will provide a series of leadership workshops to nonprofits in the four SAAFdn impact areas — Cultural Vibrancy, Livable and Resilient Communities, Youth Success, and Successful Aging in San Antonio — who are committed to social change, policy impact, and/or community improvement that serve communities of color throughout San Antonio.
  The six-month nonprofit leadership program is focused on strengthening relationships from diverse communities of color. Applicants may be executive directors or senior program staff at their sponsoring organization. San Antonio Equity Fellowship Program will result in strengthened leadership for community impact, increased cross-cultural understanding, bolstered community collaboration to address pressing social issues, and a network of diverse leaders who will be able to call upon each other in the future.</p>

          <p>One of the many devastating effects of the pandemic has been an increase in domestic violence. The <span>Bexar County Family Justice Center</span>, a critical service provider to victims of domestic violence, had to find a way to remain open. This was no easy feat, given that it is typically an in-person, walk-in program.
Before the pandemic, the Area Foundation had already begun the transition to trust-based philanthropy allowing organizations to focus on their mission and adjust or apply the grant dollars where they were needed most. This pivot to operational funding enabled the Bexar County Family Justice Center to apply the needed funds to provide crisis intervention and support services to a larger-than-normal client base. </p>

        As the country embarked on renewed racial reckoning ushered by the horrendous murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, the reverberations of growing social unrest were soon felt here in San Antonio. The community needed bona fide sources of leadership that could help tackle racial injustice and work toward establishing equity. The San Antonio Area African American Community Fund (SAAAACF), a charitable fund of the San Antonio Area Foundation, was repeatedly pointed out by News 4 WOAI, San Antonio Magazine, and national nonprofit circles as a go-to organization in the Alamo City. The organization has quietly but effectively advocated for the Alamo City’s Black community for more than a decade. “We want to be a major player,” said Bobby Blount, Chairman of the SAAAACF Board of Directors and a figure in the local educational scene, serving on the Board of Trustees of the Northside Independent School District. “People started looking around to see which organizations were willing to step up and we quickly realized that we needed to be more engaged, providing more leadership in the community.”

            <h3>Words from former chairman of the board</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              A conversation with a colleague about recognizing scholarship donors at our school caused me to reflect on my own experience  —  first as a scholarship recipient 25 years ago and now as someone who funds scholarships. 
              As scholarship donors, my husband and I could choose to bequeath gifts to help future students, or we could give now so that we have an opportunity to meet the people we’re helping. The conversation with my coworker along with my shared desire to meet our scholarship recipients made me think that I should reach out to those who helped me along my own academic journey.
              Much has transpired since graduating from Judson High School in 1995 and then attending Texas A&M University with the help of a scholarship from the San Antonio Area Foundation. I feel it’s important to send an updated note of thanks to the Foundation to express my sincere gratitude for the impact that their gift had on my life and career. The Foundation scholarship helped me achieve my initial goal of earning my bachelor’s degree in psychology in 1998. The Foundation grant helped me graduate from college without the need for loans.
              After graduation, I pursued a career in higher education, and I have enjoyed working for the Texas A&M University and Texas State University systems. The highlight of my career was having the opportunity to work in Qatar at Texas A&M University’s branch campus for eight and a half years. I was able to support the educational aspirations of Aggie engineers from over 20 different countries and travel extensively in my free time.
              My experience of living, working, and traveling abroad has deepened my understanding for the need to embrace diversity and to include perspectives from underrepresented groups. My time abroad afforded me the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, preparing me for my current role as Assistant Dean for Accountability and Strategic Initiatives at Texas A&M’s School of Public Health.
              My professional success began with the Foundation’s early investment in me. In turn, my husband and I have been able to fund several scholarships for students at Texas A&M, providing financial assistance to the next generation of professionals. None of this would have been possible had it not been in part for the Area Foundation. 
              Thank you again for the work you do to support future generations of students and thank you again for helping me pursue my dreams.

              Thanks to the generosity of our donors, the Area Foundation awarded <span>$4.6M</span> in support of <span>905 scholarship grants</span> in 2020. The Area Foundation hosts more than 100 scholarship funds available for graduating high school students and current college students. Each fund has its own criteria based on the fund advisor’s interest. Some scholarships fund a specific area of study, a donor’s alma mater, or scholarships to students from a specific school.

            <h3>A Match Made in Heaven: Remembering and Honoring the Legacy of Jack and Laura Richmond</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Those lines shape the long-standing philosophy of a cherished local couple who may now be gone from our lives but whose legacy will live on for years to come through the dedicated work of their charitable fund.
              Jack and Laura Richmond may not have been born and raised in San Antonio, but how lucky are we that they ended up settling here as their longtime adopted home? Certainly, those working in philanthropic circles are all the better to have had the honor of seeing many wonderful nonprofits benefiting from The Richmond Family Foundation.
              “My father was always very proud of how generous this city is as a whole,” said their youngest son, Clay Richmond. “He wanted to contribute. He just wanted to help people and create opportunities to see them grow.”
              The Richmonds were originally from Kansas, where Laura worked as an elementary school teacher while Jack rose as a manager for the phone company. Despite being business entrepreneurs, it was never about the bottom line for Jack and Laura. Far from it. The couple was always about giving back to their community, first by contributing to various causes and nonprofits and then starting their own philanthropic fund in 1998 at the Area Foundation. 
              “I think he wanted to more succinctly direct his giving where he thought organizations could have a positive influence on those they were serving,” Clay Richmond explained. “And the matching grants could be a launching pad for those organizations.”
              Indeed, the matching aspect of The Richmond Family Foundation grants are what makes it unique. One nonprofit each year is selected to be eligible to receive $100,000 — as long as they raise the same amount or more on their own. The incentive has proven more than fruitful, given that on average participating nonprofits raise $180,000. In all, the Richmonds thus far have contributed $1.4 million to 14 San Antonio nonprofits. 2020’s recipient was Jewish Family Service of San Antonio. Talk about going beyond the minimum requirement — the agency raised $200,000 on its own, making the combined $300,000 infusion as the largest fundraiser in its history. 
              “It was a lifesaver as it allowed us to continue our services right as the pandemic hit, as well as start offering teletherapy for our counseling clients and provide home essentials for our homebound senior clients,” said Talli Dolge, CEO of Jewish Family Service.
              Jack and Laura represent the type of quiet, no-nonsense philanthropy that is quintessentially altruistic — giving with no expected or assumed reciprocity. “They’re humble, not flashy. They are not in it for themselves. It’s not about them, but about the nonprofits they support,” Board Member and family friend Brad Parman offered. “It’s truly inspiring to watch.”

            The Donor and Development Services team equips each donor with the tools they need to make informed decisions about where, how, and when to give. The San Antonio Area Foundation accepts a wide variety of assets and can facilitate even the most complex forms of giving. We partner with professional advisors to create highly effective approaches to charitable giving. We offer the maximum tax advantage for most gifts under state and federal law. 
The Center for Corporate Philanthropy at the San Antonio Area Foundation, launched in 2020, hosted a virtual townhall for fundholders and key business leaders featuring Darryl Walker, President of the Ford Foundation. Mr. Walker provided keen insights on how corporate citizens could help lead a robust and equitable rebound for the nonprofit sector during and after the pandemic, as well as challenging the lack of diversity on corporate boards.

            Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) are donor-directed charitable funds administered by the Area Foundation, which provided an additional $7 million in grants made directly to nonprofits impacted by COVID-19, while also contributing $1.2 million to the COVID-19 Response Fund. Additionally, Donor Advised Fund grants directly supporting nonprofit organizations totaled $42.3 million for 2020.
DAF grantmaking grew 33% in the first and second quarters of 2020 compared to the same time in 2019, with 95% of all giving in response to COVID-19 staying in Bexar County. This sharp increase is directly attributable to independent donors’ urgent concern for nonprofits working on the front lines of the crisis.
