- white backgrounds to F4F4F4
- first slider scroll and fade transition
- second slider whatever
- font and animation
- clear console log functions
- header transition is faster when returning to first slide
- update h3s
- reverse scroll deactivate elements with active class
- section tags without section specific classes
- on click arrow scroll to max page position (fade in arrows all the way if they are clicked before animation is completed)
- duplicate animation actions with different start and stop values
- section 9 - 10 background transition 
- all background transitions
- 12 - 12a 50% or 100%?
- toggle class for side panels....
- subsection numbers to letters to avoid confusion in higher numbers
- scroll start and stop call back
- padding left on all slides
- slide z-index update range
- start property values. either hard coded in stylesheet or set in action constructor
- Regex px or % propertyStart and Stop will require parsing of start and stop
- bottom shadow on overflow scroll containers
- dynamic element limit 
- asset loading in increments. grab all asset links and load them async groups of 5 or 10 cache sizes then async in groups of 5 - 25 maybe do not waste time with that right now
- resize window set timeout and resettimeout to update dummyheight

- when the window is resized, adjust dummy height
- transition all properties to only necessary properties
- Cross browser animation properties (css .page-loaded)
- Consider updating from transition duration xx[s] to xx[ms]
- Insert overlay via js
- Scroll dummy from id to class
- May as well set styling properties at animationaction construct instead of requiring inital animation styling in main.css
- Search for dirty just incase something was overlooked
- set dummy height- maybe set dummy height to max scrollStop aka the last anmiationaction scrollStop + window height--- on page load (window height * number of sections) ( do not forget obscure scroll length when considering window height vs actual scrollable distance. Scrollable distance is dummy height - window height or something like that)
- completed styling is dirty
- slide z-index to prevent slides at a deeper level from popping into view prematurely
- if scroll position is in between animations, scroll to top to prevent confusion
- when side panels are active disable scroll-dummy


- slide 3 background really should be absolute and the text really should be relative....
